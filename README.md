# Space Game

## Overview

This is a simple space-themed game developed using Pygame. Players control spaceships, represented by different colors, and aim to defeat their opponent by firing bullets. The game was created by following a tutorial by [TechwithTim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY).

## Instructions

1. **Download the Files:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Run the Game:** Execute the main file (`main.py`) to launch the game.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Players control spaceships using keyboard controls.
   - Yellow Spaceship (left side) uses keys `a`, `w`, `s`, `d`, and left command for firing bullets.
   - Red Spaceship (right side) uses keys `up`, `down`, `right`, `left`, and right command for firing bullets.
   - Each time a bullet hits a spaceship, the health of that spaceship decreases.

## Additional Features Implemented

- **Bullet Collision:** Bullets from opposing spaceships cancel each other upon collision.
- **Cheat Mode:** Modify the `cheat_mode` variable to `True` in the `main.py` file to make the game easier. Take control of the Red Spaceship for a more relaxed experience.
